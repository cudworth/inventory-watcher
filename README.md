# inventory-watcher

Python script for monitoring item inventory at Costco.com and notifying the user via text message once an item is available for purchase.

Dependencies:
Python3, Selenium, and Twilio

User will have to build a unique credentials.json file including user's Costco and Twilio account information for the script to function. Open a free trial account at Twilio for text messaging service - for the relatively small number of text messages sent by this script, a free/trial account will be sufficient.
